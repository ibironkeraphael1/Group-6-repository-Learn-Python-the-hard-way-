#Exercise 28: This exercise focuses on logic.
# The NOT table

print(not False)      # True
print(not True)       # False

# The OR table

print(True or False)   # True
print(True or True)    # True
print(False or True)   # True
print(False or False)  # False

# The AND table

print(True and False)  # False
print(True and True)   # True
print(False and True)  # False
print(False and False) # False

# Combined logic (NOT OR / NOT AND)

print(not (True or False))  # False
print(not (True and False)) # True

# Not Equal (!=)

print(1 != 0)  # True
print(1 != 1)  # False
print(0 != 1)  # True
print(0 != 0)  # False

# Equal (==)

print(1 == 0)  # False
print(1 == 1)  # True
print(0 == 1)  # False
print(0 == 0)  # True


#Exercise 29: This exercise involves playing around with boolean expressions and practicing them
# 1. Simple comparison
print(1 == 1 and 2 == 2)

# 2. Testing inequality
print(10 < 20)

# 3. A complex one from the drill
print(not (True or False) and (5 != 4))

 # Below is a guide to show how the NOT equal to operator works
print(1 != 0)  # Should show True
print(1 != 1)  # Should show False
print(0 != 1)  # Should show True
print(0 != 0)  # Should show False

# Testing "Equal" (==)

print(1 == 0)  # Should show False
print(1 == 1)  # Should show True
print(0 == 1)  # Should show False
print(0 == 0)  # Should show True

#Exercise 30: This exercise shows and focuses on the use of the 'What If' statement
#Variables were created because the statement requires values to operate on, without variables the statement's output would be null
people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15

if people < cats:
    print("Too many cats! The world is doomed!")

if people > cats:

if people < dogs:
    print("The world is drooled on!")

if people > dogs:
    print("The world is dry!")

dogs += 5

if people >= dogs:
    print("People are greater than or equal to dogs.")

if people <= dogs:
